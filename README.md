# AB Testing

As I am familiar with A/B testing in regards to UI, I was excited to learn it's set up as a Marketing Analyst.

For this task I:
- deployed a simple HTML site using Netlify
- inserted the Google Tag Manager (GTM) tracking tag into the head of the HTML document
- created a Google Analytics 4 account and connected it to GTM
- designed a two stage A/B test to run on Google Optimize using principles of User Experience and Conversion Centered Design
- deployed A/B test

Assessing the site, I determined two areas I wanted to focus on to and try to increase performance: the image and the call-to-action.

## üíª Test 1 

Knowing that the call-to-action is the most important part of any webpage, I redesigned it in Google Optimize to draw more attention and increase conversion.

## üíª Test 2

Following the directional cue principle of Conversion Centered Design, I flipped the image so that the man's eyes are focused on the area we want you to read: the paragraph above the call to action. This sort of subtle change has been shown to draw the user's attention to the desired action, a click on the download button.

## ‚ûï Bonus Test

Since I work effeciently I had extra time for a bonus test. I created an additional design for an ecommerce site I had previously deployed and tagged.

Using Google Optimize, I changed the copy to make it less formal and potentially more appealing to chocolate shop customers.

## üèÅ Key Learnings

In this task, I learned how to set up all connections needed to get an A/B test up and running. I also drew upon my design psychology knowledge to create a test that will increase conversion. Unfortunately, as this was a school project, I didn't receive data to be able to analyze results.
